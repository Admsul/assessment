I used 600px as a break point for mobile view.
In mobile view I introduced a really simple hamburger menu, created by toggling classes on what appears onscreen.

I chose to use basic CSS rather than importing and using bootstrap. 
I might possibly revist this as alittle project and introduce bootstrap.

I decided to use simple stylings with gradients and drop shadows as I think it can look good if used in moderation.

Working by myself my git managment is poor. I should have done this with different branches for different features such as for nav, form and footer.
